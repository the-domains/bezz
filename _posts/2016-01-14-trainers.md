**_Motivation_**

I once heard a
sport psychologist say that if someone could figure out how to motivate human
beings, and this method could be applied to every single person on earth, that
individual would have more money than they would know what to do with! 

Motivation is the foundation of my exercise programs.

Success = Set Goals + Commit + Work Hard
